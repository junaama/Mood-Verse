## Code Snippet
* It was really fun learning user authentication and I liked figuring out how it works in the backend
```
router.post("/register", async (req, res) => {
  try {
    let { email, password, password2, username } = req.body;

    if (!email || !password || !password2) {
      return res.status(400).json({ msg: "Not all fields have been entered" });
    }
    if (password !== password2) {
      return res
        .status(400)
        .json({ msg: "Enter the same password twice for verification" });
    }
    const existingUser = await User.findOne({ email: email });
    if (existingUser) {
      return res
        .status(400)
        .json({ msg: "An account with this email already exists" });
    }
    if (!username) {
      username = email;
    }
    const salt = await bcrypt.genSalt();
    const passwordHash = await bcrypt.hash(password, salt);

    const newUser = new User({
      email,
      password: passwordHash,
      username,
    });
    const savedUser = await newUser.save();
    res.json(savedUser);
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ error: err.message });
  }
});
```
## Bugs & Fixes
* Accidentally pushed mongodb uri key in my git commit
    * I had to delete my backend git repo and start over
* Record button only working on mobile
    * It was a css issue, I styled the div surrounding the button, and the button was rendered as maybe 2-5px, so clicking on the actual button was near impossible. I fixed it by adding the styling to the button itself.
* I set up my verses schema in a convoluted nested travesty...
* My verses schema was setup as an array holding an object holding objects of arrays - This caused issues trying to use API calls
    * I had to redo my verses schema so there wasn't a deeply nested array that I needed to access.
#### Things I learned
- Webhooks [https://simonfredsted.com/1583]
* Webhooks allow for API's to send if data has been updated
    * In programming, the word “hook” comes from the phrase “hooking into” something, so a Webhook is hooking into an event, or making the application call it whenever the event happens. The application has a list of hooks that must be notified whenever a given action occurs, but since Webhooks are usually asynchronous, the application doesn’t wait for a response. In your example, let’s say there’s an app that has created a Webhook for when you’re picking up your keys from the table (before going outside) — the event. When called, it can then check the weather and send you an alert on your phone saying that it’s raining. - Simon Fredsted
- Speech Recognition API
- Contact Form with nodemailer in the backend to send mail over smtp
- User authentication in MERN stack using JWT tokens, bcrypt
- Using cookies to store user sign-in information
- Investing time to research the material I will be using (APIs, Libaries) is crucial.
